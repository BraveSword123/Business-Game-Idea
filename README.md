# Business Visual Novel (Work in Progress)

## 📖 Overview

This is a simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript-based **visual novel prototype**, where the player is introduced to a fictional business by the quirky and expressive owner. The player interacts with the scene by clicking through dialogue and eventually entering their name, which is later used in the story.

The project is designed as a foundational framework for a branching dialogue system and can be extended into a full visual novel game.
